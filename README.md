# Uno Playground

This is the code for published apps on stores (_Uno Gallery_) - Windows, Android & iOS
and for the _Uno Playground_ <http://playground.platform.uno>.

## Building it

You'll need Visual Studio 2022 Preview to compile it. You also need those components:

- Web Site development (aspnet core)
- .NET 8 Preview

## Wasm

Run the project `Uno.Playground.WASM` - that's the `platform.uno` web site
and go to the url `/Playground/index.html` once it's started (don't use the link
in the site, it will bring you to the public version).
